- One ToR is required and two is recommended for redundancy
# Software Components of the VxRail System
## VxRail HCI Systems Software
VxRail is based on a modular system architecture, which is composed of individual nodes and system software.

1. Echo-System connectors integrate with infrastructure components, including vSAN, physical appliance components, and networking.
2. RESTful APIs help customers deliver a broad level of cloud and IT automation extensibility with a wide-ranging set of APIs
3. VxRail HCI system software includes automation and orchestration services for VxRail clusters and system wide end-to-end life cycle management.
4. The secure connect gateway serves as a secure conduit for devices to send event files to the backend. The event files include errors, alerts, warning conditions, health reports, configuration data, and script execution statuses.
5. Software as a Service (SaaS) multi-cluster Management provides insights to enable detailed health checks, and predictive analytics. 
6. VxRail Manager is a system virtual machine, that is used to deploy the initial configuration of the cluster, perform regular maintenance, add nodes and complete upgrades.

## VMware Software Components
A hyper-converged platform has four tightly integrated software components: 
- Storage virtualization
- Compute virtualization
- Networking virtualization
- Advanced management, including automation
![[Pasted image 20250119145618.png]]
1. <u>VMware Tanzu</u> is an optional modular cloud native application platform that accelerates development, delivery, and operations across multiple clouds.
2. <u>VMware Aria Suite</u>; formerly name vRealize Suite; is an optional platform for managing a heterogeneous, hybrid cloud hosted on VxRail. It provides cloud management functionality, including self-service, automation, and intelligence operations.
3. <u>VMware Cloud Foundation</u> is an optional multi-cloud platform that provides a full-stack hyper-converged infrastructure. VCF is made for modernizing data centers and deploying modern container based applications
4. <u>vCenter Server</u> provides a single point of management for the VxRail vSphere infrastructure and VMs. VxRail includes a vCenter server instance and an external one can be used. 
5. <u>VMware vSAN</u> is a storage virtualization software that creates and manages virtual data storage devices that are derived from the physical storage devices within each VxRail node. Virtual data-stores are accessible to all VxRail nodes in a cluster.
6. <u>VMware vSphere</u> is the foundation of computer and network resource virtualization and management. vSphere includes ESXi and vCenter Server.
# Storage Options for VxRail
## VxRail Primary Storage
There are two types of clusters:
- VxRail vSAN clusters - vSphere clusters that use vSAN as the primary storage.
- VxRail dynamic node clusters - vSphere clusters that use primarily external storage
## VxRail vSAN Clusters
VxRail vSAN primary storage architecture ->
- Original Storage Architecture (OSA) - vSAN OSA is a two-tier, disk-group-based 
- Express Storage Architecture (ESA) - vSAN ESA is a single-tier storage for optimizing performance on all-NVMe devices
## VxRail Dynamic Node Cluster
VxRail dynamic node clusters are <u>compute-only</u> nodes that are attached to external storage. Having separate compute and storage resources allows independent scaling of each.
## VxRail Secondary Storage
]In addition to the primary storage, VxRail can be configured to use external storage, this can be helpful in migrations, backup, and moving VMs
<u>Fibre Channel SAN</u>
VxRail can connect to an external storage array through a Fiber Channel HBA 
<u>iSCSI</u>
VxRail also can connect to an external storage through iSCSI
<u>NFS</u>
VxRail can connect to an external storage array using NFS
# VxRail System Management
The VxRail manager is a virtual machine running a VxRail management software. It provides a web user interface (UI) to deploy clusters. After the initial deployment of the VxRail cluster, the functionality is managed through the vCenter in the vSphere with the VxRail plugin.
The VxRail Manager functionality is ->
- <u>Deploy</u> 
	This functionality includes
	- VxRail Node Discovery 
	- Initial cluster configuration
- <u>Monitor</u> 
	This functionality includes
	- Health
	- Events
	- Physical views
- <u>Maintain</u>
	This functionality includes 
	- Direct access to support, articles and community
	- Secure connect gateway
	- Smart diagnostics
	- Smart logging snapshots
	- Node maintenance including disk replacement and cluster expansion
- <u>Update</u> 
	This functionality includes
	- Updates by internet or local software
	- Viewing or generating compliance reports
## vCenter Server with VxRail
VxRail is integrated with vCenter Server to provide management, maintenance, and monitoring of the virtual infrastructure.
### vCenter Server
vCenter server is a centralized platform for managing the following objects in the VxRail infrastructure:
- vSAN cluster
- vSAN datastore
- ESXi Hosts
- Virtual Machines
- Virtual Networking
![[Pasted image 20250120171025.png]]
### vSphere Management
The vSphere client is a user-friendly interface for managing components such as ESXi hosts, vSAN cluster, vSAN datastore, and virtual machines. The VxRail Manager plugin enables administration over the physical hardware of the cluster.

### iDRAC
The iDRAC is a small computer that is connected directly to the server, and can manage the server from far even if it is down and it provides ->
- Remote Virtual Console 
- Remote Power Management
- Firmware Updates
- Secure Connectivity

# Data Protection Options for VxRail
## Overview
VxRail provides several data protection options to meet various customer requirements. 
The Options are ->
## vSAN Stretched Cluster
This is a native vSAN software feature that provides customers with site-level protection with zero data loss and near instantaneous recovery. This setup has automated fail-over if there is a site failure. <u>This is recommended for customers that are looking for disaster avoidance and zero recovery point objectives</u>
## VMware vSphere Replication
This is a hypervisor-based, asynchronous replication for VMs. It is fully integrated with vCenter Server and the vSphere Web client. vSphere replication can provide local data protection and and appropriate for disaster recovery solutions between sites and <u>is recommended for environments that can tolerate some data loss</u>

<u>ALSO LOCAL BACKUPS CAN BE USED</u>
# Overview of SDDC Manager and VxRail Manager
