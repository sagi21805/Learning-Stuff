The challenge was a simple function that uses the gets function for input, and it is needed to be overflowed to overwrite the key and get a shell to print the flag.
After reversing the function and analyzing it, this is what we get

We want to overflow the buffer until the key offset, and then put the right key, and for that we need to understand the stack of this function
_Assuming the base address EBP is zero_

| Address     | Value                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| (-44)-(-12) | Input buffer to overflow       |
| (-12)-(-8)  | buffer overflow protrction     |
| (-8)-0      | # empy? (not relevant)         |
| 0-4         | saved EBP from main            |
| 4-8         | saved EIP from the _call func_ |
| 8-12        | KEY                  

After tracing the stack, we can infer how much we need to overflow the buffer, for example for this buffer, we need to overflow -44 which is the start of the buffer, all the way to +8 where the key is located, although this will overwrite the return pointer, which typical buffer overflow will want to target, it will continue the jump to a shell so we don't mind that. 
The wanted key is the number 0xCAFEBABE, so we need to input it backwards because of little endieness
#note 
Another interesting thing to notice is the _mov eax, large gs:14h_ instruction which reads from local thread storage into the eax register. this is a buffer overflow check, that is between our buffer and other variables, and it is check in the end of the function to defend the _EIP_ pointer, but it does not affect us, because we want to run a shell.

The command to overflow it in the correct is 
```bash
(python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"a"* 52 + b"\xbe\xba\xfe\xca\n")'; cat) | nc pwnable.kr 9000
```
This command write 52 time the letter 'a' which overflows the buffer until the key (52 = 44 + 8), then we insert the bytes of the key in reverse, and we use the cat command so the session between us and the server will not close. then we forward it to the server with |, and we get the shell, in which we can write _cat flag_ to get the flag.
