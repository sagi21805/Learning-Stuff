A file descriptor is a handle inside the process into a file, and it has its own unique ID. for example 0 is the stdin, and if a file will be opened by the process for example in this code 
```python
with open("SomeFile.txt", "w") as f:
	f.read()
```
A new file descriptor will be opened, and reading and writing to it will write to the actual file (this is a symlink to the file).

The given code was reading from a file descriptor, which is a process unique identifier for a file, which it can read or write from. Every process in Linux has 3 default file descriptors: 
1. <u>stdin</u> -> standard input
2. <u>stdout</u> -> standard output
3. <u>strerr</u> -> standard error
The code read from a given file descriptor minus 0x1234 offset and needed the string "LETMEWIN\n"
<u>Solve</u>
```bash
echo 'LETMEWIN' | ./fd 4660 
```
This puts the string "LETMEWIN\n" in the standard input because of the pipe, then the read is from file descriptor 0 which is the input because 4660 - 0x1234 is 0 (4660 decimal = 1234 hex)
