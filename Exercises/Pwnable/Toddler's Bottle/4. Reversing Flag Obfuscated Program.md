When running the binary this message is printed
```
I will malloc() and strcpy the flag there. take it.
```
When opening the binary we can see almost no functions, even less then a hello world program. 
This is big clue that indicates that the program is <u>obfuscated</u>
Trying to reverse the obfuscation is a hard task, be can be doable, instead I decided to look at the file strings, maybe the flag is in plain text there.
```bash
strings flag.elf
```
After this command we can see a very interesting string
```
$Info: This file is packed with the UPX executable packer http://upx.sf.net $
$Id: UPX 3.08 Copyright (C) 1996-2011 the UPX Team. All Rights Reserved. $
```
After checking out UPX which is a very common program packet, we download the UPX packer with 
```bash
sudo apt install upx
```
Or with a windows installer, platform dependent
After that we run
```bash
upx -d flag.elf
# This will decompress the file
```
After reversing the new binary, we can see all the functions, and a quick search in the main function will show us the flag which is ->
```
UPX...? sounds like a delivery service :)
