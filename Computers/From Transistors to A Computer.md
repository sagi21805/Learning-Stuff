# What are Transistors
Transistors are mechanical switches, Each transistor has 3 legs
- <u>Collector</u>  -> Electricity flow
- <u>Emitter</u> -> The output
- <u>Base</u> -> Input signal
![[Transistors.excalidraw]]

When the electricity flow in the collector, it doesn't flow to the Emitter unless a voltage is also applied to the base which creates an electrical switch 
# Logic Gates
The combination of transistors can create something that is called logic gate (Even one transistor can be a logic gate)
Each logic gate can be described both by a sequence of transistors but also with a <u>truth table</u> which is a table that
