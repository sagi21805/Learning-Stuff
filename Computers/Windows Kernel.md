# Deferred Procedure Call (DPC)
Every driver that has an ISR most likely also have a DPC routine to complete the processing of the interrupt driven I/O operation, a typical routine does the following. 
- Finish handling I/O operation that ISR has begun processing
- Dequeues the next I/O Request Packet (IRP) so that the driver can begin processing it.
- Completes the current IRP, if possible
Sometimes the current IRP cannot be completed because several data transfers are required, or a recoverable error was detected. In these cases, another DPC routine typically reprograms the device for either another transfer or a retry of the last operation.
## How DPC is Used with ISR
For example, imagine a network packet entering the Network Card, the network card sends an interrupt to the CPU, and the ISR is triggered, which will acknowledge the packet that entered and will queue a DPC for the processing of the packet, if there are no more interrupt with higher IRQL the DPC is called and the packet is processed.
