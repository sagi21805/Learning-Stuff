# Benefits of VxRail
This is a Hyper Converged Infrastructure (HCI) and it system software integrates VMware software with Dell Power-Edge server.
- Allow organizations to start small and scale up while maintaining performance levels.
- Lays the foundation for multicloud deployment; simplifying operations with software driven automation.
- Provides processing analytics that are required for a wide variety of workloads.
VxRail delivers the fastest and simplest path to IT solutions in a VMware environment.
# Hardware Components of the VxRail System
## VxRail Nodes and Components
VxRail nodes are based on Dell Power-Edge servers and offers configuration flexibility
Each node contains ->
- Processors 
- DIMMs
- Disk drive controller
- Boot device
- Hybrid, all flash / NVMe storage
- Onboard networking
- iDRAC port
Nodes can include ->
- Graphical Processing Units (GPU)
- Smart Data  Processing Units (SmartDPU)
- Fiber Channel Host Bus Adapter (HBA)
- Optional network interfaces
# VxRail Physical Network Infrastructure
VxRail nodes are configured on the ToR switches with the following networks:
- Management
- vSAN
- vMotion
- Virtual Machine
## General Requirements
ToR (Top of Rack) switch requirements for all VxRail models are ->
- The switch must support layer two (but can support layer three as well)
- Switch ports for VxRail nodes must be 10, 25 or 100 GbE
- One ToR is required and two is recommended for redundancy
# Software Components of the VxRail System
## VxRail HCI Systems Software
VxRail is based on a modular system architecture, which is composed of individual nodes and system software.

1. Echo-System connectors integrate with infrastructure components, including vSAN, physical appliance components, and networking.
2. RESTful APIs help customers deliver a broad level of cloud and IT automation extensibility with a wide-ranging set of APIs
3. VxRail HCI system software includes automation and orchestration services for VxRail clusters and system wide end-to-end life cycle management.
4. The secure connect gateway serves as a secure conduit for devices to send event files to the backend. The event files include errors, alerts, warning conditions, health reports, configuration data, and script execution statuses.
5. Software as a Service (SaaS) multi-cluster Management provides insights to enable detailed health checks, and predictive analytics. 
6. VxRail Manager is a system virtual machine, that is used to deploy the initial configuration of the cluster, perform regular maintenance, add nodes and complete upgrades.

## VMware Software Components
A hyper-converged platform has four tightly integrated software components: 
- Storage virtualization
- Compute virtualization
- Networking virtualization
- Advanced management, including automation

1. <u>VMware Tanzu</u> is an optional modular cloud native application platform that accelerates development, delivery, and operations across multiple clouds.
2. <u>VMware Aria Suite</u>; formerly name vRealize Suite; is an optional platform for managing a heterogeneous, hybrid cloud hosted on VxRail. It provides cloud management functionality, including self-service, automation, and intelligence operations.
3. <u>VMware Cloud Foundation</u> is an optional multi-cloud platform that provides a full-stack hyper-converged infrastructure. VCF is made for modernizing data centers and deploying modern container based applications
4. <u>vCenter Server</u>
